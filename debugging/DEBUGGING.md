  phone: "123-456-7890",
  branchId: 1,
}

The application create a new employee with the values provided in the request body and assign a unique epmloyee id for it.

### Analysis

-   What did you learn from this scenario?
Answer: destructure the object could make the code more simple and readable.
-   Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?
Answer: No for this moment.
-   Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?
Answer: At this moment, there are no obvious areas for improvement or refactoring.
-   How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?
Answer: I found that if there is extra properties not related to the employee, it also could be stored in the employee data, so we need data validation for request body or model validation when create new employee.
